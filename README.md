# Foundry Virtual Tabletop - BFRPG Game System

This game system for [Foundry Virtual Tabletop] (http://foundryvtt.com) provides character sheet and game system 
support for the Basic Fantasy Role Playing (BFRPG) system (https://www.basicfantasy.org/).

This is an unfinished alpha version of the system. It was forked from the Foundry VTT 5th Edition game system v1.1.1 and in an attempt to [hopefully] remain compatible with at least some of the Dnd5e-specific modules for Foundry, changes from the DnD5e system were kept to a minimum. The was developed on Foundry 0.7.6


NOTES:
=======

* The character sheet is mostly automated and automation features that were present in the Dnd5e system should still work.

* The rules incorporated into this BFRPG are from the core rulebook only. The only exception is that d12 is used for initiative rolls rather than d6.

* BFRPG Compendiums were started, but are unfinished. The compendium files are located at: ./packs/bfrpg

* The weapons and armor compendiums are finished. The spells compendium is done up until the Passwall spell. Rules, Class, Race, and Monster compendiums are not started. The 5e compendiums are left in the ./packs directory as a starting point to modify into BFRPG compendiums.

* CSS changes to the character sheet were made directly to the bfrpg.css file and NOT to the .less files used to generate it. Porting changes into the .less files should be done at some point.

* To see what was changed from DnD5e v1.1.1 use diff tools.
